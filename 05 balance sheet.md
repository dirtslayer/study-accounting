# balance Sheet

A balance sheet is a summary of a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity for a given accounting period. The owners (also known as the investors) use the data as a measure of how the company stands in regards to current assets (or items owned by the company) and liabilities (or items that are in accounts payable status). Here are a few examples of assets and liabilities:
