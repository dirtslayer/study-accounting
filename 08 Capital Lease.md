# Capital Lease

Accounting for capital leases is complicated because you are treated as the owner of the leased item. You must figure out the fair value of the asset, separate lease payments between principal and interest, and record depreciation. As the owner, you're also responsible for all repairs and maintenance. Additionally, you can incur a loss if the leased item is damaged. This is very different than what one would be used to with apartment rentals. There's no calling the landlord to take care of a problem. You own the problem and must contract with someone to fix it. If your goal is to finance the purchase of an asset such as a building, then a capital lease is an option.
