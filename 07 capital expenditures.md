# Capital Expenditures

When businesses purchase physical items that enhance or maintain their performance, but are not regular everyday expenses, this expense falls under the category of a capital expenditure.

## Balance Sheet and Fixed Assets

 A fixed asset is an accounting term that refers to a physical asset that cannot readily be converted to cash. This would include things like office furniture, property, or equipment.

There are two types of capital expenditures:

Upgrade of fixed assets
Investment in future growth

Capital expenditures are located on the balance sheet in the section entitled fixed assets. A fixed asset is a physical asset that cannot readily be converted to cash. It is a long-term asset that will be useful for more than one year. It is capitalized, meaning that it is spread out over time and depreciated. 

Capital expenditure = purchase of new fixed assets + upgrades to existing fixed assets - sale of any fixed assets during the accounting period
