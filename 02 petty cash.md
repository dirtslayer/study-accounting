# Petty Cash

It doesnt make sense to pay with check for smaller items, a check can be written to another account or person, the money which can be used but still tracked, minus the checkbook

The Petty Cash fund will usually provide reimbursements for small office expenses as long as the purchaser is able to supply the custodian with a receipt documenting the purpose and amount paid.

It is reloaded by posting the expenses in the expenses account and taken from that account. 

So there is only an initial ammount going directly to petty cash and from there on, the items will be summarized and moved to the expense account and money from the expense account will replenish the petty cash account.
