## GAAP The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

Economic Entity Assumption
Monetary Unit Assumption
Time Period Assumption
Cost Principle
Full Disclosure Principle
Going Concern Principle
Matching Principle
Revenue Recognition Principle
Materiality
Conservatism

The economic entity assumption means that any activities of a business must be kept separate from the activities of the business owner.

The monetary unit assumption means that only activities that can be expressed in dollar amounts can be included in accounting records.

The time period assumption means that business activities can be reported in distinct time intervals. These intervals may be in weeks, months, quarters, or in a fiscal year. Whatever the time period is, it must be identified in the financial statement dates.

The cost principle refers to the historical cost of an item that is reported on the financial statements. Historical cost is the amount of money that was paid for an item when purchased and is not changed to account for inflation.

The full disclosure principle means that all information that is relative to the business be reported either in the content of the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements.

The going concern principle refers to the intent of a business to continue operations into the foreseeable future and not to liquidate the business.

The matching principle refers to the manner in which a business reports income and expenses. This principle requires that businesses use the accrual form of accounting and match business income to business expenses in a given time period. For example, a sales expense should be recorded in the same accounting period that sales income was made.

The revenue recognition principle addresses the manner in which revenue, or income, is recognized. This standard requires that revenue be reported on the income statement in the period in which it is earned.

The materiality principle refers to the measure of importance of a misstatement in accounting records. For example, if the price of an asset is understated by $10.00, will that misstatement have enough effect on the financial statements to matter? This is a gray area in accounting standards that requires professional judgment to be used.

The last principle that makes me up is conservatism. Conservatism is the principle that calls for potential expenses and liabilities to be recognized immediately if you are unsure whether they will actually occur or not, but potential revenue not to be recognized until it is actually received.
